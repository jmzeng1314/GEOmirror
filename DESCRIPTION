Description: Due to the poor internet speed of mainland China, 
              the researchers can hardly downlaod the GEO dataset by getGEO function from GEOquery package.
              So I write this GEOmirror package which only offer geoChina function, 
              it's very easy to use, for example :  geoChina('GSE1009')
